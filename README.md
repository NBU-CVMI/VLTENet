# VLTENet
This repository contains the code for the paper "VLTENet: A Deep-Learning-Based Vertebra Localization and Tilt Estimation Network for Automatic Cobb Angle Estimation".

## Notes:

We notice that the AASCE challenge dataset has some incorrect annotations. Relevant researchers have also found this problem and have given the code to fix it.

Our adjustment of the AASCE dataset is consistent with the way in the above code.
